## 💡 How It Works

### Lending (Supply)

1. Connect your Web3 wallet
2. Select the asset you want to lend
3. Enter the amount to supply
4. Approve the transaction
5. Start earning interest immediately

### Borrowing

1. Supply collateral to the protocol
2. View your borrowing power
3. Select the asset you want to borrow
4. Enter the amount (within your limit)
5. Confirm the transaction
6. Receive borrowed assets instantly

### Repayment

1. Navigate to "Your Borrows"
2. Select the loan to repay
3. Enter repayment amount
4. Confirm transaction
5. Collateral is released proportionally

### Withdrawal

2. Select the asset to withdraw
3. Enter withdrawal amount
4. Confirm transaction (if no active borrows against it)

   
## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔗 PushChain Network Integration

Deland is deployed on **PushChain**, a high-performance blockchain network designed for scalability and efficiency.

### What is PushChain?

What is Push Chain?
Push Chain is a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain built to eliminate fragmentation across all chains.

Push enables you to build Universal Apps that can support transactions from any chain (Ethereum, Solana, EVM L2s, L3s) - without requiring users to juggle between multiple wallets, tokens or gas mechanics.

In short, Deploy once, go cross-chain & 10X your user base.

Deland leverages the **Push chain SDK and UI Kit** 


### Connect to PushChain

To connect your wallet to PushChain network:

**Network Details:**
- **Network Name**: Push Chain Testnet
- **RPC URL**: Push Chain Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 42101
- **Currency Symbol**: PC
- **Block Explorer**: donut.push.network

Add these details to your MetaMask or Web3 wallet to interact with Deland on PushChain.
